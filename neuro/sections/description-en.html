<span class="markdown">
The classes of this ontology describe specific parts of the hypothesis that we create. For example, if we ask DISK "Is APOE4 gene associated with Hippocampal Volume?" it will use the ontology to determine APOE4 as an instance of Gene and Hippocampal Volume as an instance of a Brain Charcacteristic. DISK can then identify a hypothesis pattern and trigger a line of inquiry that matches the classes used (Gene, Brain Characteristic, etc.) and execute workflows to support or refute the hypothesis. <img src="hypoPic.png" alt="DISKhyp"> </span>
